This goal of this vignette is to show how to read and summarize a JSON data set in R. The JSON data used in the examples is from the National Hockey League REST API.

## Introduction to JSON

Describe JSON data. What is it, where does it get used, and why is it a good way to store data? This
should be detailed enough that someone that hasn’t seen JSON data would have a good idea what they
are dealing with. You should link to references where applicable.

## Reading JSON in R

Discuss the possible packages/functions that are available for reading JSON data into R. (There are
three major packages for JSON data.) Choose one and explain why you’ve chosen it.

Let's read some data!

• Write functions to contact the NHL records ‘Franchise’ API (the previous text is a link) and return well-formatted, parsed data:
– You should have a function to return parsed data from the following calls:

∗ /franchise (Returns id, firstSeasonId and lastSeasonId and name of every team in the history of the NHL)

∗ /franchise-team-totals (Returns Total stats for every franchise (ex roadTies, roadWins, etc))

∗ /site/api/franchise-season-records?cayenneExp=franchiseId=ID (Drill-down into season records for a specific franchise)
· User should be able to specify the franchise

∗ /franchise-goalie-records?cayenneExp=franchiseId=ID (Goalie records for the specified franchise)
· User should be able to specify the franchise

∗ /franchise-skater-records?cayenneExp=franchiseId=ID (Skater records, same interaction as goalie endpoint)
· User should be able to specify the franchise

## Summarizing Data

Once you have the functions to query the data, you should perform a basic exploratory data analysis.
Not all things reported need to show something interesting or meaningful (i.e. graphs that show no
relationship are fine) but you should discuss each graph (if you don’t know hockey, that is ok - simply
discuss the graphs and summaries as best you can). A few requirements are below:

– You should create a new variable at some point
– You should create some contingency tables and numeric summaries by some of your categorical variables
– You should create some plots (at least a side-by-side bar plot, side-by-side box plots, and scatterplots with coloring)

### Numeric Summaries


### Graphical Summaries
